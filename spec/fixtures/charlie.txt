Here's the story of Charlie, a little robot

It's early morning and the sun is just rising.
Charlie is at his home on the south side,
looking out over the horizon at the sunrise:
PLACE 2,0,EAST

He decides to go for a little walk:

Good thing Charlie's Navigator chip stopped him.

Suddenly, a bird flies past...

Charlie sits down at a Cafe and orders some food.
It's so delicious!
Let's take a photo and share it on Robook.
But wait, what's our location?

Ahh, that's better. Others will know this is a great cafe.
Now, let's go to the park to play with Marv.

Mum calls. "Where are you Charlie?"
REPORT

"Please come home at once! You need to take care of Lola today."
Good thing Charlie's Navigator supports multiple placing.
PLACE 2,0,EAST
REPORT

"I'm home mum!"
Charlie will have to play with Marv another day.
